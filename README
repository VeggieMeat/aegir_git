This is basically a fork of VeggieMeat/aegir_cid (which is a fork of mig5/aegir_cid)

This particular script is intended to be used to deploy sites to Aegir from Git
via Jenkins. Basically, where the original used Drush Make, this script uses Git.

My reason for this is that, while Drush Make works in many cases, I prefer to have
all of the codebase for a site immediately available through a simple Git clone. It
works and I don't have to think as hard as I do to build a Drush Make file. Is it
more resource intensive to go this route? Perhaps, or perhaps not - I haven't taken
the time to measure, and honestly don't plan to.

USAGE:

/usr/local/bin/aegir_git/deployment.sh aegir.example.com your.site.com profile webserver dbserver git@git.example.com gitrepo gitbranch ${BUILD_NUMBER}

For example, in my case I might use the following to deploy staging.vmdoh.com from the
"staging" branch onto a web/db server combo called xray-rs01.vmdoh.com:

/usr/local/bin/aegir_git/deployment.sh alpha-rs01.vmdoh.com staging.vmdoh.com standard xrayrs01vmdohcom xrayrs01vmdohcom gitolite@golf-rs01.vmdoh.com vmdoh staging ${BUILD_NUMBER}



TODO

* Add means of checking if dev/staging versions already exist and, if so, clone the
  appropriate version


KNOWN ISSUES

Aegir <= 1.6 seems to force the db_server to localhost in the drush alias file.
Seems fixed with Aegir 1.7.
